        <div class="message-container" id="messageContainer">
          <div class="message" id="message1">Hey Janhavi, <br>
                                            It will be weird and unexpected, but please read it till the end.</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message2">I know that this is not the right time, and you have been through a lot.<br> 
                                             I understand that, but I have something important to tell you.</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message3">It took me a month to come to the conclusion that I need to share what I feel for you.<br>
                                            I really like you.<br>
                                            I realized this over the past three months, but I was afraid to tell you directly. <br> 
                                            So, I came up with the idea of this webpage. <br>
                                            It has an advantage — you can't slap me if you don't like it! 😅</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message4">Do you know what attracts me most about you?<br>
                                             It's not just your looks (though you are beautiful),<br>
                                            but it's who you are, your behavior, and the kindness you show.<br>
                                            You care about every single friend, and that's what attracts me the most.</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message5">You suffering a lot but  One thing I am sure about is that<br>
                                             I may not be perfect for you, but I will try hard to be the best for you.</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message6">"Let's flip a coin: if it's heads, I will be yours; if it tells, you will be mine."<br>
                                              Yes, it was me who wrote a confession by your name on this confession page.<br>
                                              I was afraid to tell you directly, So I did that.</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message7">I know these lines are a bit cheesy. Here's another one:<br>
                                             "Even if there was no gravity on Earth, I'd fall for you all the same."</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message8">This is my first time confessing to someone. If I did something wrong, I'm sorry.</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message9">Don't worry, I haven't told anybody about this. I don't want to give anyone a topic for gossip.</div>
      
          <div class="message" id="message10">It's up to you, whatever your answer is, I will respect it.<br>
                                             Just think about it and please give me a chance to be a part of your life.</div>
